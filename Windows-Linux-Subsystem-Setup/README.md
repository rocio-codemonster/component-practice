# Install the Windows Subsystem for Linux
Enable the "Windows Subsystem for Linux" optional feature and reboot.
1.- Open PowerShell as Administrator:
    ![open powershell as admin](admin.png)
    
2.- In your PowerShell run: 

```shell
Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux
```
    
3.- Restart your computer when prompted.

4.- Once your System restarts, open the Windows Store and search for **Ubuntu**.

5.- Select _Get_

6.- When it's done installing open a PowerShell and type `wsl`.

7.- Finally, type this in `wsl`:

`sudo apt install -y build-essential zlib1g-dev libsqlite3-dev libpq-dev libreadline-dev`

It will ask for the password you created for your Linux Subsystem.

Voil√†! You have a Linux Subsystem on Windows üëçüèº

## Things to keep in mind
- Every time we mention _Command Line_ it refers to the `wsl` enabled PowerShell.

- **Do not** open the Ubuntu shell (click on the Ubuntu icon) as it will open a Command Line located in a different folder than your current environment.
